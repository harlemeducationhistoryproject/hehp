The Harlem Education History Project is a collaborative effort to document and share the history of learning and schooling in Harlem.

This is a test site for the project's new website, still in development. 

Access our book, [_Educating Harlem: A Century of Schooling and Resistance in a Black Community_](https://ansleyerickson.github.io/book/) as an open-access digital edition.
