<p>Dr. Sandye Poitier Johnson is a child of Harlem, born in 1947 to Charles and Katherine (Broadhead) Poitier, working class parents who prioritized and valued education. The Poitier’s provided their daughter with opportunities not available to them, as neither received more than an 8th grade education, which was common for many African Americans during the early to mid-twentieth century as segregation and Jim Crow laws limited African American’s school attendance and the full exercise of their citizenship rights. Mr. Poitier operated a shoeshine booth in midtown Manhattan, in an office building located at 100 Park Avenue near Grand Central Station. He  set up there by invitation from a patron in the Washington Heights barber shop where he worked. Mrs. Poitier was a draper in the garment industry; her work entailed putting the “finishing touches” on factory made garments. Despite their meager income, Mr. and Mrs. Poitier sent Sandra to The School on the Hill, a private grade school located at 421 West 145th street run by the Lutheran Church. She attended the school from Kindergarten through 6th grade.</p>

<p>The Poitier’s, like several other Harlem families in the 1950s and 1960s, did not believe NYC public schools provided a quality education to Harlem’s students, and chose not to send Sandra to their zoned public school. That school, Intermediate School 136 (IS 136), was one of several intermediate schools boycotted by Harlem families in the late 1950s; IS 120 and IS 139 were also boycotted. Parents felt that these schools failed to provide an education that prepared students to successfully complete high school and gain admission to college. Sandra attended and graduated from Olinville Junior High School (JHS 113) and Evander Childs High School, both located in the Bronx.</p>

<p>During high school, Sandra attended Ophelia Devore’s Charm School.  Devore, a former model of African American descent, founded the Grace Del Marco Modeling Agency in 1946, the first African American owned and run modeling agency in the United States. Located in the Ed Sullivan Theatre, in midtown Manhattan, Devore’s charm school cultivated the talents of thespians Diahann Carroll, Cicely Tyson, and Richard Roundtree. Dr. Johnson recalls Ms. Devore shared her deep belief that the lessons she “learned as a model needed to be transferred to young ladies.” The charm school offered classes on etiquette, walking, conversation, and wardrobe selection.  Mrs. Poitier used the lessons taught there to prepare Sandra for college and to select the items Sandra needed as she prepared to attend Morgan State College in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>

<h2><strong>The College Years: 1965 - 1969</strong></h2>

<p>Sandra Poitier matriculated at Morgan State College in Baltimore, beginning with the fall 1965 semester, graduating in May 1969. Morgan State College is one of approximately 105 Historically Black Colleges and Universities still in existence, that had their origin in schools founded during the Reconstruction era to provide education to formerly enslaved African Americans. These schools, and the higher education institutions they became, are primarily located in southern states.</p>

<p>Morgan was not Sandra’s first choice, because of its distance from her home and parents in Harlem. Despite the Poitier’s clearly expressed education goals for Sandra, an Evander Childs counselor advised her to attend a trade school, for cosmetology, instead of pursuing a college degree. Likely a white woman, The counselor’s recommendation was typical of the period typical of the period and the discriminatory practices that black students faced, as many white teachers did not expect African American students to pursue a college education. The Poitier’s summarily dismissed this myopic recommendation. They valued education and expected Sandra to complete college, because they had not completed their schooling. The Poitier’s understood that completing college provided Sandra with professional opportunities that eluded them in their lifetimes.  In spite of the discriminatory advice of her high school counselor, Sandra headed to Morgan State College in Baltimore with her proper wardrobe in tow for the 1965 - 1966 academic year.</p>

<p>As a freshman, Sandra missed and longed to return home but eventually settled into college life when the Poitier’s refused to comply with her return requests.  Sandra became “Sandye,” during her freshman year when a psychology professor suggested the moniker as it aptly captured her personality.  Sandye made several friends with whom she has maintained lifelong relationships as they bonded on campus and in the years following their 1969 Morgan graduation.  Dr. Johnson describes the years at Morgan as “the best years of my life,” because it was a place where “I was surrounded by role models who looked like me,” and where “professors took an interest” in the students as people, nurturing their intellectual growth and development – something that did not happen at predominantly white institutions (PWIs).  The years at Morgan exposed Sandye to people from varied places, and different from those she knew in Harlem. It was her classmates’ “high aspirations,” that broadened her thinking and clarified her future aspirations; ultimately bringing them into alignment with her parents’ vision and expectations for her life. At Morgan, Sandye joined the cheerleading squad; served as a class representative and became a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated in 1968; one of four African American sororities founded in 1908.   She describes herself during her high school years as “a challenged student,” and  therefore majored in  psychology believing she would become a psychologist.</p>

<p>Almost every student attending an HBCU during the 1960s was exposed to protest and activism on campus or in the local community as African Americans continued the long fight for actualization of the rights granted by the Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution – citizenship and the right to vote. As a student from the North, Sandye’s daily life experience had been very different from that of her Morgan State classmates born and raised in the South. She notes, “I could sit anywhere I wanted on the bus,” unlike her southern classmates who were required by Jim Crow to either sit in the back of the bus or give up their seat to white passengers. She continued, “I could go in any store;” this didn’t mean that there wasn’t any difference in the treatment she received; just that she was not barred from entering or making a purchase. In the North, Dr. Johnson recalls, proprietors and employers “didn’t hire people of color,” that’s the discrimination she was most familiar with – employment and economic discrimination, covert versus the overt discrimination southern students knew all too well. Further, Dr. Johnson recalled, “in the South a lot of my friends had a … different type of experience … [with the] Klu Klux Klan.” She continues, “I used to see it on TV but it was not up in my back yard[,] … some of my friends had [to deal with] … the lynchings [and] all of that stuff[.]” Additionally, she reports her friends from Birmingham, Alabama had to deal with the aftermath of the 1963 bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church and the resulting murders of four little girls – Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, and Carol Denise McNair. In New York City, Sandye had not been exposed to this overt and violent type of discrimination or segregation.</p>

<p>Although on campus during the Civil Rights Movement, Sandye was not actively involved in Civil Rights Movement activism. One reason is that segregation had not affected her life the way it had her classmates from the South, and the other being Mrs. Poitier’s admonishing her daughter “to get that degree.”  Nearly fifty years later Dr. Johnson recalled her parent’s concern; “they did not want me [to be] kicked out of school,” an understandable position for parents guiding their only child through college as a first-generation college student at that juncture in American history. In the wake of the April 4, 1968, assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the ensuing out breaks of frustration born rioting across the country and in Baltimore, Dr. Johnson recalls being able to “see smoke from fires burning in Washington, DC.”  She reports that “Morgan closed its campus and sent students home for the semester.” While important legislation was passed during her lifetime to address segregation and voting, many urban centers inhabited by African Americans, and other communities of color declined due to precarious financial and social conditions. This is the world Sandye entered as a graduate student and professional educator in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p>

<h2><strong>Early Career, Graduate Education, and Thurgood Marshall Academy (TMA)</strong></h2>

<p>Following completion of her undergraduate degree at Morgan State College, Sandye Poitier earned her masters degree from Bank Street College of Education focusing on working with emotionally handicapped students because she felt this population had multiple learning issues. Her doctorate was earned from Teachers College, Columbia University where she specialized in Learning Disabilities and Administration and Supervision.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson began her teaching career in 1971 as a special education teacher at the Montague School in New York City, the same year she married Thomas Johnson. One of the city’s public schools, Montague served “severely emotionally handicapped” students.  Dr. Johnson recalls it being a “very unique program” because of the collaborative effort between the Jewish Board of Family and Children’s Services, and the New York City Board of Education.  Montague provided “onsite psychiatric [and] therapeutic services to [its] students” and served a population of no more than 30 students.  Staffed by an onsite psychiatrist and three psychiatric social workers, classroom sizes were limited to twelve students,  and they attended the school year-round.  Working in this type of special education environment for almost thirty years, along with ten years of experience as an adjunct professor at City College of New York (CUNY) and Kean College, rounded out the professional experience Dr. Johnson needed to effectively lead Thurgood Marshall Academy (TMA) when recruited for the Principal’s position in 1996. Dr. Johnson was familiar with the school and its goals as she was involved with Abyssinian Development Corporation as they renovated and developed housing, created a head start program, and ultimately created a high school. The grade and middle schools were developed later and became potential feeder schools for TMA. As a member of the team that wrote the proposal for TMA, Dr. Johnson volunteered at TMA in its early years – in addition to her full-time teaching responsibilities – assisting its leadership team with afterschool training and supporting TMA’s teachers.</p>

<p>Thurgood Marshall Academy resulted from an Abyssinian Development Corporation proposal submitted to New Visions for Public Schools in 1992. The objective was to develop a plan for “a public school that could deliver quality educational services that would impact student performance.” Reverend Calvin O. Butts, senior pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, was the impetus behind the Church’s decision to submit an application.  Dr. Johnson indicates that it was Reverend Butts’ belief that “if our community was going to change for the better, that even though we [develop] better housing and have economic development, … it would not persist if we did not have highly educated community [members].”  At that time, the quality of Harlem’s schools “was not great” and parents continued sending their children outside of the community for better schools.” The creation of TMA thus, addressed a decades long battle – almost 60 years – between the NYC Board of Education and concerned parents in Harlem over the quality of education provided for their children. Dr. Johnson was familiar with these parental decisions as they were very similar to the ones the Poitiers’ made about her education in the 1950s and 1960s, and those voiced by parents in the 1930s. They had chosen to send their daughter to a private school – The School on the Hill, and public schools in The Bronx – Olinville Junior High School and Evander Childs High School – rather than trusting her education to a Harlem public school. Reverend Butts believed that community parents “should have a choice of good schools where they lived; and if they chose to send their children outside of the community then it should be a [true] choice and not a forced option.”  Dr. Johnson and six additional Abyssinian members drafted the TMA proposal. Of the three hundred applications submitted, only twelve proposals were selected. TMA became one of the few NYC high schools with a student population of less than 600 students.</p>

<p>First housed in IS 201 – now the Choir Academy building – located on one full city block in East Harlem, TMA moved to the old IS 136 building located on Edgecombe Avenue between 135th and 136th street in 1993. The IS 136 building has housed several schools over the years, when TMA was there, the space was shared with Bread and Roses.  While the Committee was not involved in the day to day running of TMA, they were involved in the principal selection process.  During its early years TMA averaged one principal per year and was labelled a failing school by NYC’s Department of Education (DOE).  School data showed decreasing student performance, and metal detectors were installed to screen each person entering the building to ensure no weapons were brought into the school environment.</p>

<p>In TMAs second school year the Committee began to actively work with TMAs leadership.  Based on the school’s poor performance, Reverend Butts reached out to Dr. Johnson, in March of 1996, to personally request she assume leadership of TMA as its principal. She did not accept the job offer until May 1996 and describes her acceptance of the offer as “a give back to Harlem,” the community in which she was raised and continues to live, and that nurtured and protected her as a young child and teenager.  Dr. Johnson spent 15 years as principal of Thurgood Marshall Academy, providing leadership and support, and acting as a resource and advocate to the school community and Harlem.  In February 2004, TMA moved from IS 136, located on the north east corner of 135th street and Edgecombe Avenue, to its new location - two blocks east, on the south west corner of 135th street and Adam Clayton Powell Junior Boulevard, the former location of Smalls Paradise.</p>

<h2><strong>A Changing Harlem: 1947-2013</strong></h2>

<p>Nearing the two-hour mark in her interview, Dr. Johnson turned her attention to the changes she’s seen in Harlem and the effects of two decades of gentrification on the community.</p>

<p>With gentrification, Dr. Johnson notes there was a rise in police presence, retail and recreation offerings, hotel spaces, and a decline in the number of Black-owned and operated businesses in Harlem. She dates the beginning of gentrification to the 1980s noting it was clearly visible by the 1990s. The increasing police presence began during the 1990s when properties were inexpensive and white people began moving back to Harlem. It was during the early twentieth century that Harlem became a black community as migrants from the South and the Caribbean moved to New York City. Their arrival along with the movement of African Americans, from points further south in Manhattan, increased their concentration in Harlem by large numbers causing Harlem’s white residents to leave the area rather than live in close proximity to African Americans. Black New Yorkers made Harlem the Black cultural capital of the world. The community thrived during the Harlem Renaissance yet with the advent of the Great Depression and  white flight from the area African Americans in the community struggled, as did the rest of the country, with economic and social problems endemic  to a  country and  City financially struggling to remain afloat and meet the needs of its citizens. Dr. Johnson posits that it was September 11, 2001 that hastened the residential and commercial changes seen in present day Harlem. She says, Harlem is accessible; “I think 9/11 changed all of that; because on 9/11 there were all kind [of] people up here in Harlem[.] … because it appeared to be the safest place[,] people were walking through our community dazed[,] but it was a safe place[.]  … [T]hen people really started moving uptown … they left downtown[;] no one wanted to live downtown anymore.”</p>

<p>Another change Dr. Johnson notes is the “infusion of charter schools,” and questions why Harlem has “the most charter schools per square mile than any other community in the United States.” She believes it’s a “decline of respect for public education” bolstered by the belief that public education is “inferior,” while noting, NYC public schools have produced “successful people” who have made significant contributions to New York City and the world at large. While many parents view charter schools as viable options to DOE schools, Charter Schools are often criticized for their rigidity, and emphasis on conformity, with some critics claiming that they are siphoning public funding from public schools. Also compounding the effects of the changing face of Harlem is the decreasing availability of affordable housing. In our interview, she notes that “affordable housing doesn’t exist.  Abyssinian Development Corporation, … is only one of the major community organizations that is making sure that a lot of our residents are not displaced.”</p>

<p>While she lamented the loss of some of the aspects and character that Harlem held for her as she grew up, and in the years since returning after college, Dr. Johnson sees the improvements, noting I “see now the pros, … I like that I don’t have to go across the bridge or downtown to eat a Red Lobster or Joe’s Crab Shack. … I like the fact that … Whole Foods is coming [be]cause our community likes to eat healthy too, and so now we’re getting more healthy alternatives … for us to choose from.  … I [also] like it that I don’t have to [go to] 86th street anymore, …  I can walk from my house to go to the [movie] theater. I like all of those things. I like that I don’t see crack houses anymore on the block that my house is on; and most of the owners on my block live in their houses.  … Its diverse you know, we tend to be a good community on our block, I love my block you know … this is a great block to live on.” She concluded, “I would never live anywhere else but Harlem, I think Harlem … is a community and a family; when you walk down the street … I can never get to my destination without someone saying hello someone may not know you but will always say hello.” In closing our discussion Dr. Johnson states … “my husband really wants to move down south I told him to go. I would never leave Harlem. There is no place that has the cultural diversity and history that Harlem has of our people. Plus, New York, I would never leave it; it has mass transportation. Is it perfect? No, but it gets you from point A to B wherever you want to go 24 hours a day, and it has the best health institutions, the best everything.… It’s not perfect, but no place is perfect and … I would never live anywhere else, I love Harlem, I breath Harlem, I would never leave.”</p>
